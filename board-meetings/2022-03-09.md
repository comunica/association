Webinar over Zoom (1 hour) (side-goal: attracting contributors)
Planning:

- 10 min: Insights into internals (algebra, joins, actor-mediator-bus, ...)

Webinar will take place with a limited audience to make sure questions are focused.
The presentation will be recorded, and made public on YouTube (as part of a playlist that may be extended in the future).

Actions:
- We will mention Solid

- Place our own bounties with following priority:
    - High-priority bugs: https://github.com/orgs/comunica/projects/2
    - Issues towards roadmap
- Outreach for finding contributors willing to take up bounties
    - Partner with sponsors to find contributors via their outreach channels
    - Spam social media every time there is an interesting thing to work on (like a bounty)
