# Comunica Association - Board Meeting November 25 2022

These notes will be made public after the meeting on https://github.com/comunica/association

**Planning**:

Priority:

- Core maintainers

Less urgent:

- Budget application
- AOB

## Presence

Ruben Taelman
Jacopo Scazzosi
Jesse
Pieter C

## Core maintainers

Currently Ruben T merges PRs. Should more people be able to merge PRs, in case Ruben T is unavailable?

A system like each PR requires approval from at least 2 core maintainers, but if more than a week goes by, then just 1 core maintainer is sufficient.

If Ruben approves, can be merged immediately.

Core-maintainer can comment to stall the 1 week deadline if he really wants to review it.

ACTION:
- RT: Document this on website
- RT: Set this up in GitHub

## Budget application

3 bounties are being worked on.
1 bounty was unclaimed: https://github.com/rubensworks/jsonld-streaming-parser.js/issues/76

    - https://github.com/rubensworks/jsonld-streaming-parser.js/pull/102

4.5K in Open Collective, so more developers could be working on things at the current pace.
More outreach?

Mastodon? Discuss again next meeting.

ACTION:
- RT: Add rule that if no reply in 1 week, developer is unassigned from bounty.
- JW: Inspect Solid forums, and make connections.
