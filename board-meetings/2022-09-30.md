## Association launch

Online event:
- Up to 18 viewers live
- 179 views as of today
- Several people said they wanted to have more of these, especially on the deeper internals of comunica.

Semantics:
- Many people were already using comunica (in)directly
- Good opportunity for networking and possible funding in the future
- No developers found

## Impact of sponsors on the roadmap

Should long-time sponsors also gain (some) influence on the roadmap?

=> the board can invite long-term sponsors to board meetings when roadmap changes are made. This is already in the rules

Alternative solution: the board can only make up to 30% sponsors. (look at TC39 as example)

## Budget application

1 bounty was recently completed, 4 WIP currently.

## AOB?
