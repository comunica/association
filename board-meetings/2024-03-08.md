=> RT: go

Things have been quiet for a while.
I expect renewed interest after release of Comunica v3.

## Long-term budget usage

Thought: I heard the Python Software Foundation mainly uses their funds for community building events instead of  actual dev. Idea here is that community building will lead to more volunteer devs than actually paying them. Should we consider the same? Would require aligning with sponsors.

=> Keep paying developers
=> Release event for v3?
=> Conferences? Meetups? Online? (prefer physical)
    => Co-located with conferences
    => Ask NDE (Netherlands)
    => Make list of places/times we want to consider
    => We want to target developers
    => UGent summer school, which we can get funding for?
    => Meetups, like Ghent-JS

=> RT: look into this.

## AOB?

Comunica v3 will be coming soon!

=> Focus efforts more on federated SPARQL querying, and omit Solid for now (until requirements would come from Solid)
