# Comunica Association - Board Meeting August 24 2022


These notes will be made public after the meeting on https://github.com/comunica/association

**Planning**:

Priority:

- Association launch

Less urgent:

- Membership status
- Budget application
- Future outlook

## Presence

Jacopo, Jesse, Ruben T, [Pieter C](https://pietercolpaert.be)

## Association launch

Launch event:

- Making weekly announcements of speakers via Twitter and LinkedIn
- YouTube livestream video already available on https://comunica.dev/events/2022-09-07-association_launch/
- 15 registrations via EventBrite so far (but I guess most people will just drop in without registration)

Semantics:

- Flyers have been sent to Vienna
- Poster is printed

## Membership status

New member: Digitaal Vlaanderen

## Budget application

Placed:

- https://github.com/comunica/comunica/issues/1044
- https://github.com/comunica/comunica/issues/1029
- https://github.com/comunica/comunica-feature-solid/issues/30
- https://github.com/comunica/comunica/issues/994

2 of them have already been claimed by 2 new developers, with possibly a third developer developer starting soon.
Tpt is started a new job soon, so he may not be able to work as much anymore.

Our budget is now going down faster than it's going up, so hopefully there's new interested from sponsors after the launch event. Otherwise, we won't be able to post new bounties anymore.

Possible alternative: microfunding via NLNet: https://nlnet.nl/

## Future outlook
