## Association launch

    - Still have to look into a page-refresh system with YT embed.
- Semantics
    - Sponsored talk (see slack)
    - Slides (see slack)
    - Leaflets + poster (see slack)

## Budget application

Placed:

- Remove dependency on Node.js APIs: https://github.com/comunica/comunica/issues/857
    - Almost completed!
- Expose ESM modules: https://github.com/comunica/comunica/issues/930

Probably around 4K left after all current bounties are paid, so there's some budget left to place more bounties.
