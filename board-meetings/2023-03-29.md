8 new bounties have been placed: https://comunica.dev/association/bounties/
Waiting on several of them to be paid out.

=> RT: Investigate Open Collective fiscal host: https://docs.opencollective.com/help/collectives/change-fiscal-host 

## Roadmap update

Current roadmap: https://comunica.dev/roadmap/

- Future-oriented development
- Improving overall performance
- Developer experience
- Outreach

Proposal from RT: no new goals, but re-ordering of priorities:

- Improving overall performance
- Developer experience
- Outreach
- Future-oriented development (lowered, because this requires a large budget, which we don't have)

Should we add an element: Stability (perhaps as first element?)

=> Include tangents:
* IoT: Jacopo
* Solid: Jesse/RubenV
* Digital Heritage
* Data spaces
=> Also link to https://comunica.dev/research/#experiments ?
