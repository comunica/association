# Comunica Association - Agenda for next Board Meeting

These notes will be made public after the meeting on https://github.com/comunica/association

**Planning**:

Priority:

- Core maintainers

Less urgent:

- Budget application
- AOB

## Presence

TODO: fill in your presence

## Core maintainers

Currently Ruben T merges PRs. Should more people be able to merge PRs, in case Ruben T is unavailable?
Perhaps a system like each PR requires approval from at least 2 core maintainers, but if more than a week goes by, then just 1 core maintainer is sufficient?

See guidelines in https://comunica.dev/contribute/

## Budget application

1 bounty was recently completed, 4 WIP currently.

TODO: any bounties we want to create? (smaller ones, for new devs?)

## AOB?

TODO: ?
