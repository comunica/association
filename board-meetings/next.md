# Comunica Association - Agenda for next Board Meeting

These notes will be made public after the meeting on https://github.com/comunica/association

**Planning**:

Priority:

- Roadmap update

Less urgent:

- Budget application
- AOB

## Presence

TODO: fill in your presence

## Roadmap update

Current roadmap: https://comunica.dev/roadmap/

- Future-oriented development
- Improving overall performance
- Developer experience
- Outreach

Proposal from RT: no new goals, but re-ordering of priorities:

- Improving overall performance
- Developer experience
- Outreach
- Future-oriented development (lowered, because this requires a large budget, which we don't have)

Should we add an element: Stability (perhaps as first element?)

## Budget application

8 new bounties have been placed: https://comunica.dev/association/bounties/

## AOB?

TODO: ?
