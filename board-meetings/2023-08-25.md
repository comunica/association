# Comunica Association - Board Meeting August 25 2023

These notes will be made public after the meeting on https://github.com/comunica/association

**Planning**:

Priority:

- Change fiscal host

Less urgent:

- Budget application
- AOB

## Presence

Attendees:
- Ruben T
- Jesse
- Pieter C


## Change fiscal host

Changed to Open Collective Europe.
Open Knowledge Belgium transferred our funds.
Open Collective Europe is a bit stricter on checking invoices, so payouts are taking a while.

## Budget application

Currently 10 bounties open, none are being claimed (same situation for a few months).
6K in bank account -> open even more bounties?

Another proposal: accept comunica-related funding proposals for micro grants? (small budgets, low proposal overhead)

=> RT will look into micro grants, and we will ask a legal person to checkk it.

## Statistics

We are currently at a pace of 1 bounty per month (see https://comunica.dev/association/bounties/) although most of the bounties were after the launch.

Unique bounty solvers: 6 people
