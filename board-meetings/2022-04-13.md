## Roadmap

https://github.com/comunica/association/issues/1

## Budget Application

1. New bounties: https://github.com/comunica/association/issues/2

Ruben will contact Adrian from Zazuko to discuss setting a SPARQL 1.2 prototype fund.

ACTION: place new bounties online, and announce
  => break up perf testing todo, and ping Jesse

2. Improve website/communication

Hire webdev?

Make it look more "commercial"? and user-friendly. Better communication.

Some quick-start demos to see and run how to use comunica in code. (codespace/codepen) (basic, ldflex, link traversal, ...)
Something like the JSON-LD playground to show different possibilities.

A (shared) github codespace might be useful for new comunica developers.

ACTIONS:

 - Reserve budget (amount tbt).
 - Ask input about website/communication from our people we know (see people that attend webinar).
 - create a playground (make a bounty for that?)
 - set up GitHub codespace? (target audience: contributors) (create issue)
